# Qodot-Brush-Prefabs
Simple/reusable .map structures to add to your Qodot project. Works with .map editors like Radiant and Trenchbroom.

This repo is temporary and will be maintained under [https://github.com/QodotPlugin/](https://github.com/QodotPlugin/) once a file structure and contributing guidelines have been figured out. :P
